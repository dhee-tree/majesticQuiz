# Majestic Quiz

## By: Ighomena Odebala

Welcome to my Majestic Quiz repository. This repository contains the code for the test B - Vue and reactive frameworks and the test C - visualising data.

- To view the code for the test B - Vue and reactive frameworks, navigate to the `vue_task_1` directory. 
- To view the code for the test C - visualising data, navigate to the `visualising_data_task` directory.

Each test directory contains a `README.md` file that contains the details of the task, the approach, the resources used, the language and libraries used, the installation, and the usage.

## More on deployment:
- I have deployed the vue task using GitHub pages from the [pages](https://github.com/dhee-tree/majesticQuiz/tree/pages) branch. The deployed site can be found [here](https://vue.ighomena.me).
- I have used Django to create a web application for the test C - visualising data. The code for the Django web application can be found in the [django-production](https://github.com/dhee-tree/majesticQuiz/tree/django-production) branch with its own README.md file. The deployed site can be found [here](https://vis.ighomena.me).
