# Majestic Quiz

## By: Ighomena Odebala

Welcome to my Majestic Quiz repository. This repository contains the code for the test B - Vue and reactive frameworks and the test C - visualising data.

- To view the code for the test B - Vue and reactive frameworks, navigate to the `vue_task_1` directory. 
- To view the code for the test C - visualising data, navigate to the `visualising_data_task` directory.

Each test directory contains a `README.md` file that contains the details of the task, the approach, the resources used, the language and libraries used, the installation, and the usage.

## More on visualising data task:
I have also used Django to create a web application for the test C - visualising data. The code for the Django web application can be found in the [django-visualisation](https://github.com/dhee-tree/majesticQuiz/tree/django-visualisation) branch with its own README.md file.
